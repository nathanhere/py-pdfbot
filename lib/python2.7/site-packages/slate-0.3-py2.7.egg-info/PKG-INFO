        slate: the easiest way to get text from PDFs in Python
        ======================================================
        
        
        Slate is a Python package that simplifies the process of extracting
        text from PDF files. It depends on the PDFMiner package.
        
        Slate provides one class, PDF. PDF takes a file-like object and
        will extract all text from the document, presentating each page
        as a string of text:
        
          >>> with open('example.pdf') as f:
          ...    doc = slate.PDF(f)
          ...
          >>> doc 
          [..., ..., ...]
          >>> doc[1]
          'Text from page 2...'
        
        If your pdf is password protected, pass the password as the
        second argument:
        
          >>> with open('secrets.pdf') as f:
          ...     doc = slate.PDF(f, 'password')
          ...
          >>> doc[0]
          "My mother doesn't know this, but..."
        
        More complex operations
        -----------------------
        
        If you would like access to the images, font files and other
        information, then take some time to learn the PDFMiner API.
        
        
        What is wrong with PDFMiner?
        ----------------------------
        
          1. Getting simple things done, like extracting the text
             is quite complex. The program is not designed to return
             Python objects, which makes interfacing things irritating.
          2. It's an extremely complete set of tools, with multiple 
             and moderately  steep learning curves.
          3. It's not written with hackability in mind.
